    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

    <!-- First paragraph explaining Time Complexity -->
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. An efficient algorithm minimizes time complexity, aiming for the lowest possible growth rate to handle larger inputs effectively. Understanding time complexity helps developers write faster programs that scale well with large data sets.</p>

    <!-- Second paragraph explaining Space Complexity -->
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input. For an algorithm with space complexity <b>O(n)</b>, the memory usage grows linearly with the input size. This typically happens when storing data like arrays or lists that grow with the size of the input. It's important to consider space complexity to avoid excessive memory usage, especially when working with large data structures or in environments with limited memory.</p>
