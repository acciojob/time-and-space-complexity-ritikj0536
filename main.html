	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. An efficient algorithm minimizes time complexity, aiming for the lowest possible growth rate to handle larger inputs effectively.</p>
	<p> <b>Space complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input.For an algorithm with space complexity **O(n)**, the memory usage grows linearly with the input size. This typically happens when storing data like arrays or lists that grow with the size of the input.</p>
