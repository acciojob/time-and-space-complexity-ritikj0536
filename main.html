    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity and efficient is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size.  
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> and O(n) measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input. For an algorithm with z, the memory usage grows linearly with the input size.</p>
